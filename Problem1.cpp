// We are writing a program that:
/*
"Student Records" indicate student performance in their courses. 
These records are input as a text file with the following values separated by commas: 
- Name of course 
- Last name
- First name
- List of scores for the course and their weights. 
Each course will have a different number of scores and weights. 

Example: 
Physics,Tip,Q,87.3,95.0
Literature,Dawg,Phife,95.0,85.0,98.0
Physics,Muhammad,Ali Shaheed,97.0,80.0
History,White,Jarobi,85.0,84.0

There are three courses: Physics, History, and Literature. 

Physics course should have two scores: homework (80% of grade) and lab (20% of grade).
History course should have two scores: exam1 and exam2. The higher grade is weighted 60% and the lower grade is weighted 40%.
Literature course should have three scores: analytic (40%), creative (40%), and commentary (20%).



The assignment is to: 

Input the values in a csv record that is specified on the command line. 
Print the list of students in each course separately, as well as their overall averages. 
Print the total averages for each course.
